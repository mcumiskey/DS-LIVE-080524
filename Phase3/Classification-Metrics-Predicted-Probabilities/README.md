# Classification Metrics 2

This lecture walks through the theory and practice of plotting and calculating AUC-ROC with a classification example.

## Learning Goals

* Calculate and interpret probability estimates
* Adjust the threshold of a logistic regression model
* Visualize, calculate and interpret the AUC-ROC metric

## Lecture Materials

[Jupyter Notebook: AUC-ROC](AUC-ROC.ipynb)

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (5 Mins)

There are lots of ways to tweak your model to improve specific classification metrics. AUC-ROC provides a framework for understanding the tradeoffs involved and evaluating a model based on the whole range of possible tweaks you could make

### Scenario: Classifying Heart Disease (30 Mins)

Walk through the theory and practice of calculating estimated probabilities and adjusting thresholds with a specific example.

### Scenario: Breast Cancer Prediction (20 Mins)

Have students visualize, calculate and discuss AUC-ROC themselves for a new example, possibly in pairs.

### Conclusion (5 Mins)

Brief connection to log loss and oversampling, open Q&A

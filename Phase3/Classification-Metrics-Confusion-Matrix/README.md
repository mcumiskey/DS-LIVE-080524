# Classification Metrics 1

This lecture walks through a classification example with an imbalanced dataset to motivate the calculation of different metrics and demonstrate the importance of choosing the right metric for your problem.

## Learning Goals

* Calculate and interpret a confusion matrix
* Calculate and interpret classification metrics such as accuracy, recall, and precision
* Choose classification metrics appropriate to a business problem

## Lecture Materials

[Jupyter Notebook: Classification Metrics](classification_metrics.ipynb)

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (5 Mins)

There are many ways to evaluate a classification model, and your choice of evaluation metric can have a major impact on how well your model serves its intended goals. This lecture will review common classification metrics you might consider using, and considerations for how to make your choice.

### Scenario: Identifying Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions (30 Mins)

Walk through the example, pausing to discuss the implications of the various calculated metrics and which are most important/relevant for the problem.

### Scenario: Breast Cancer Prediction (20 Mins)

Have students calculate and discuss metrics themselves for a new example, possibly in pairs.

### Conclusion (5 Mins)

Brief connection to multi-class problems, open Q&A
